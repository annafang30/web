    <p>
    All of the cones in our retina are different and respond differently to light. While some respond more to red light, others respond better to 
    blue light. Many people have color blindness, a condition where certain cells in the retina function differently than normal. Some colors
    may be interpreted differently by their brain and eyes. Color blindness is usually genetic and has no cure. However, special contact lenses
    and glasses can be useful.
