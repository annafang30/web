Second place has to go to Dobie. I think I have a thing for the grumpy dad-like characters. Originally a lazy type villager in previous games like Sherb, this older wolf was renewed as a cranky type villager in New Horizons. There's something about how the wrinkles and folds on his face are rendered that's just so endearing. Based off a Mexican wolf, Dobie is a gray wolf with white highlights and feet. His eyes are usually closed and I have to admit that they are sort of creepy open (just two small yellow dots). As a cranky villager, he often gets into conflicts with other villagers. However, he does pretty well with normal and lazy types. A big factor in why Dobie made it into the top three is his house. With a traditional Japanese exterior, his house resembles a detective's office. The worn and messy interrior is super cozy and the theme music is honestly one of the best things in the gane. I also hold a connection with him since my friend helped me find him! I had terrible luck trying to find him during villager hunts, so she picked him up for me when she ran across him. Plus, his catchphrase is "ommmm". Super cute. There's a lot more small details that I won't go into detail with, but the <a href = "https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Dobie"> animal crossing wiki is a great place for information. </a>
