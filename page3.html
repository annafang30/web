    All of the cones in our retina are different and respond differently to light. While some respond more to red light, others respond better to 
    blue light. Many people have color blindness, a condition where certain cells in the retina function differently than normal. Some colors
    may be interpreted differently by their brain and eyes. There are many different types of color blindness concerning different colors. 
    Color blindness is usually genetic and has no cure. However, special contact lenses and glasses can be useful. Even though the perception of color 
    may be hard for those with color blindness, there's plenty more in life to enjoy.
