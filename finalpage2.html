      <h2> how do these graphs work? </h2> 
      <h3> Wrong guesses </h3> 
      <p> This first graph has a Y axis labeled “# of games played with # of guesses” that tells the player how many games they played with the number of (wrong) guesses listed on the X axis. Every time that the player plays a round of hangman, new additions to the bar graph are added to reflect the number of their wrong guesses. </p>
         <br> 
      <h3> Win lose ratios </h3> 
      <p> The second graph, “Win lose ratios!”, has a Y axis named “# of games” and an X axis with labels saying “Win” and “Lose”. Every time that the player finishes a round of hangman, the win or lose bar will increase by one. 
         <br> 
      <h2> What does this teach us? </h2> 
         <p> Shown on this website are 2 versions of the “Attempts used to win” and “Win lose ratios!” graphs. We found that these two sets of graphs show improvement after playing Hangman multiple times. </p>

      <h4> Win lose ratios </h4>

         <p> Set one contains graph 1, the result from game 1 and graph 2, the result from game 2. In the first set, the player won 60% of the time, but in the second set, the player won 100% of the time. In the first set, the player used an average of 7 attempts for each word, but in the second set, the player used an average of 3 attempts to guess a word. This shows a clear improvement. </p> 
      <h4> Wrong guesses </h4>

         <p> As the player familiarizes themselves with playable words, the number of wrong guesses gradually decreases. The player had a decrease of 57.1429% from 7 guesses to 3 guesses, again showing a improvement as the player plays </p>
