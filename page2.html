         No build up here, Sherb is hands-down my favorite character. Sherb is a lazy blue goat who sports a cozy gray winter sweater. Because ACNH has many <a href = "https://game8.co/games/Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons/archives/284542international"> versions of the game, </a> there's plenty of variations in his name. For example, his Japanese name is REM while his German name is Morpheus.  Because of his personality type, Sherb is often found inside his home napping. However, if you do run across him while he makes a venture out of his house, he will often talk about bugs and feeling hungry. I find that he tends to get along with other villagers pretty well, but he tends to confuse the jock type characters because of his unwillingness to work out with them. His house is purple and blue themed; to be honest, it's quite basic. However, the exterior of his house is pretty cute with its blue walls (maybe I'm a bit biased). Because he's a fairly new character, he does not have an Amiibo card at the moment. Thus, it's somewhat of an achievement to get him on your island. (I will reveal that I spent a ridiculous amount of accumulated nook miles to get him. Do I regret it? Never.) I enjoy his laid back personality, and you have to admit that he's cute. (I mean his catchphrase is "bawww". Isn't that just precious.)
