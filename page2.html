    <p>
    when light hits an object, some of it is absorbed and some of it is reflected. The amount or specific wavelengths absorbed depends on the object iself. 
    When you look at an object, the wavelengths from the reflected light determine the color you percieve. When looking at color, there is a complicated
    process to register it. The pupil provides an opening for the light to enter while the lens changes the shape of the eye's focus. As the light enters the eyes, 
    it reaches the retina. The retina contains cones, tiny cells that respond to light. The resulting signal from your retinae is sent through nerves to your brain. 
    There, the information enters the visual cortex where it is processed. Eventually, a color returns.
