      <p> Hangman is a game where a player is given an unknown word or phrase. This unknown word or phrase is represented by a series of dashes that are the length of the unknown. Usually, hangman is played physically through pen and paper, but for this project, we will be digitizing it. In the game of hangman, the player guesses the unknown word through guessing the letters in the word within a certain amount of tries. For every wrong guess, one new body part of the hangman drawing (a man hanging from a post) will be added. If this picture is completed (the word is not fully guessed), then the player loses. If not, the player has won!

   <h2> So how do I play? </h2>
   <br>
   <p> Please download this <a href = "https://github.com/annafang30/web/raw/main/wordsandphrases">file of words and phrases </a>. This file will allow you to access the words/phrases necessary to play the game. One word/phrase will be randomly chosen from this list! When prompted for your guess, only input CAPITAL letters. You will have 9 strikes until the hangman is fully drawn and you lose the game. For every wrong guess, you will be notified that the letter is not in the word and the amount of lives that you have left. If the letter is correct, the letter will be printed on the screen in its corresponding underscore space. At the end of the game, if you have fully guessed all of the letters in the word/phrase correctly, please type the word/phrase in all caps with proper spacing and punctuation. This will allow you to win the game (plus, you get a cool congratulations message!). When you are done playing, you will be prompted to choose whether or not to play again. If you choose to play again, the game will restart. If not, two graphs (win/loss ratio and number of attempts to achieve a win) will be shown. Examples of these graphs (based on data we collected) will be shown and analysed on our website under "Data anaylsis".
