      <p> Hangman is a game where a player is given an unknown word or phrase. This unknown word or phrase is represented by a series of dashes that are the length of the unknown. Usually, hangman is played physically through pen and paper, but for this project, we will be digitizing it. In the game of hangman, the player guesses the unknown word through guessing the letters in the word within a certain amount of tries. For every wrong guess, one new body part of the hangman drawing (a man hanging from a post) will be added. If this picture is completed (the word is not fully guessed), then the player loses. If not, the player has won!
