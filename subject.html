    <h2>How Are Colors Percieved?</h2>

    <p>
    when light hits an object, some of it is absorbed and some of it is reflected. The amount or specific wavelengths absorbed depends on the object iself. 
    When you look at an object, the wavelengths from the reflected light determine the color you percieve. When looking at color, there is a complicated
    process to register it. The pupil provides an opening for the light to enter while the lens changes the shape of the eye's focus. As the light enters the eyes, 
    it reaches the retina. The retina contains cones, tiny cells that respond to light. The resulting signal from your retinae is sent through nerves to your brain. 
    There, the information enters the visual cortex where it is processed. Eventually, a color returns.

    <h2>Do We All Percieve Colors In The Same Way?</h2>

    All of the cones in our retina are different and respond differently to light. While some respond more to red light, others respond better to 
    blue light. Many people have color blindness, a condition where certain cells in the retina function differently than normal. Some colors
    may be interpreted differently by their brain and eyes. Color blindness is usually genetic and has no cure. However, special contact lenses
    and glasses can be useful.

    <p> 
    While humans have three types of cones, animals have a variety of cones. While dogs only have two cones for picking up yellow and blue light, 
    the mantis shrimp has 16 cones and can detect 10 times as many colors as we can. Others, like snails or clams, are only able to pick up color
    smudges, making their worlds vastly different from ours. Because of the structural differences in the pigment makeup of their eyes and the 
    brain, there is a variety of ways that animals percieve color and light.
