         Frankly speaking, I don't enjoy Tangy's personality, but her <a href= "https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Tangycharacter"> design is amazing (and she's a cat. Need I say more?).</a> A cat villager based off an orange, Tangy is a peppy villager. I actually had her Amiibo and called her to my island that way! (There's still a whole process through courting the villager and convinving them to move in, but it's super fun.) She features a green leaf ontop of her head and an orange body with a green dress. Her face has pits, referrencing the texture of the classic fruit. As a peppy villager, she is always found roaming the island (Tangy literally only goes home to sleep for three hours- she's intense.) and chatting with other villagers. She gets along well with everyone except for the lazy and cranky types that find her personality a little annoying. I personally can't handle the constant chatting with her, but the conversations can be hilarious. Her house is also super unique; It's filled with fruit themed furnature (the developers really needed to get the point across) and has a super cool orange rug. The outside is a little basic, but it's still pretty cute. Some players think her facial features make her look a little blank/confused all the time, but I honestly find that a little endearing! Don't you think so too?
