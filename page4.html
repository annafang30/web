    <p> 
    While humans have three types of cones, animals have a variety of cones. While dogs only have two cones for picking up yellow and blue light, 
    the mantis shrimp has 16 cones and can detect 10 times as many colors as we can. Others, like snails or clams, are only able to pick up color
    smudges, making their worlds vastly different from ours. Because of the structural differences in the pigment makeup of their eyes and the 
    brain, there is a variety of ways that animals percieve color and light.
