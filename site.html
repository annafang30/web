<p> Welcome! This will be a website where you can learn the basics of colors and some fun facts about them. You've probably heard about most of this material in 
science class, but I guess it's nice to have a quick refresher. In this meticulously crafted site, you will learn about the mechanics of color and how people or 
animals view them. I thought it woild be nice to discuss something that we all view as extremely ordinary. Have fun and enjoy :) </p>
