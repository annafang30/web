With the upcoming release of Sanrio themed Animal Crossing New Horizons characters (which I am extremely excited for), I thought it would be a great opportunity for me to introduce some of my favorite characters to you! Originally released on March 20th, 2020, Animal Crossing finally made its way to the switch. I think the general sentiment is that ACNH got a lot of us through the initial months of quarintine. It was nice to have a relaxing game to escape to while the world went through a hard time. The game features building relations and your very own island paradise on a peaceful (yet very expensive) plot of land. You interact with various NPCs to aid your growth, including Tom Nook, Isabelle, and Blathers. Although the game may seem fairly simple at first, there's a ton of things to do and experience in the game. You can visit the museum (I personally love the aquarium) or go shopping for clothing from the tailors shop. However, my favorite thing to do is island hopping. In the game, you can invite up to 10 villagers with eight different personalities to live on your island. Using tickets purchased with Nook Miles, finding villagers is random. There is also the option of using Amiibo cards, but those are often scarce and hard to find with the popular characters.With that, let's head into exploring some characters!

In case you're interested in more info (or perhaps getting the game yourself), here's a link to <a href= "https://www.animal-crossing.com/new-horizons/"> Nintendo's official website, </a> where you can explore the current events happening in the game like updates or general/fun info like villager birth dates and their favorite foods. I find myself scrolling through it at times to make sure I don't miss any update since I'm often very busy with school.
